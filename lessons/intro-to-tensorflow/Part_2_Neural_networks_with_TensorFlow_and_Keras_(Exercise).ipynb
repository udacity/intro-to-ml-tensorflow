Then, we'll see how to do it using TensorFlow and Keras, which provides a much more convenient and powerful method for defining network architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The networks you've seen so far are called *fully-connected* or *dense* networks. Each unit in one layer is connected to each unit in the next layer. In fully-connected networks, the input to each layer must be a one-dimensional vector (which can be stacked into a 2D tensor as a batch of multiple examples). However, our images are 28 $\\times$ 28 2D tensors, so we need to convert them into 1D vectors. Thinking about sizes, we need to convert the batch of images with shape `(64, 28, 28, 1)` to a have a shape of `(64, 784)`, 784 is 28 times 28. This is typically called *flattening*, we flattened the 2D images into 1D vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous notebook, you built a network with one output unit. Here we need 10 output units, one for each digit. We want our network to predict the digit shown in an image, so what we'll do, is calculate the probabilities that the image is of any one digit or class. This ends up being a discrete probability distribution over the classes (digits) that tells us the most likely class for the image. That means we need 10 output units for the 10 classes (digits). We'll see how to convert the network output into a probability distribution next.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exercise:** Flatten the batch of images `images` that we've created above. Then build a simple network with 784 input units, 256 hidden units, and 10 output units using random tensors for the weights and biases. For now, use a sigmoid activation function for the units in the hidden layer. Leave the output layer without an activation, we'll add one that gives us a probability distribution next. **HINT:** You can use the [`tf.reshape()`](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r2.0/api_docs/python/tf/reshape) function to flatten the batch of images."

The way to think about this is the following: for each of the 64 examples, you only want to divide by one value, the sum in the denominator. So you need `b` to have a shape of `(64, 1)`. This way TensorFlow will divide the 10 values in each row of `a` by the one value in each row of `b`. Pay attention to how you take the sum as well. You'll need to define the `axis` keyword in `tf.reduce_sum()`. Setting `axis=0` takes the sum across the rows while `axis=1` takes the sum across the columns. You will also need to use the `keepdims` keyword in `tf.reduce_sum()` to make sure the output tensor has the correct shape `(64,1)`."

    "Keras is a high-level API to build and train neural networks. `tf.keras` is TensorFlow's implementation of the Keras API. In Keras, deep learning models are constructed by connecting configurable building blocks called **layers**. The most common type of model is a stack of layers called a **Sequential** model. The model is called sequential because it allows a tensor to be passed sequentially through the operations in each layer. In TensorFlow, the sequential model is implemented with `tf.keras.Sequential`. \n",

    "* **Input Layer:** `tf.keras.layers.Flatten` — This layer flattens the images by transforming a 2d-array of 28 $\\times$ 28 pixels, to a 1d-array of 784 pixels (28 $\\times$ 28 = 784). The first layer in a Sequential model needs to know the shape of the input tensors to the model. Since, this is our first layer, we need to specify the shape of our input tensors using the `input_shape` argument. The `input_shape` is specified using a tuple that contains the size of our images and the number of color channels. It is important to note that we don't have to include the batch size in the tuple. The tuple can have integers or `None` entries, where `None` entries indicate that any positive integer may be expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Hidden Layer:** `tf.keras.layers.Dense` — A fully-connected (also known as densely connected) layer. For this layer we need to specify the number of neurons (or nodes) we want to use and the activation function. Note that we don't have to specify the shape of the input tensor to this layer, since Keras performs automatic shape inference for all layers except for the first layer. In this particular case, we are going to use `256` neurons with a `sigmoid` activation fucntion. \n",
